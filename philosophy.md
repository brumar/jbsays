# JBSays Development Philosophy

This is my project philosophy on AI-assisted development:

I don't believe in rigid agents workflow management, but rather in a generic prompt approach:

"This is my project, you only have few steps to improve it, I will run you thousands of times. Real Progress is not about content, it's about writing about content, at various angles and levels of abstractions, like a go player who plays first for influence and let territory build itself later. Content will flow when it's ready to flow."

## Emergent Properties Approach

The core idea is that with minimal guidance and repeated iterations, AI can:

1. Gradually improve a project
2. Organize itself with various documents
3. Discover patterns and structure naturally

This approach doesn't specify exactly *how* the AI should organize knowledge or improve the project. Instead, it allows these processes to emerge organically through many small interactions.

## The Go Strategy Metaphor

Like in the game of Go:
- First play for influence (high-level organization, documentation structure)
- Let territory (specific implementation details) build itself later
- Focus on the overall shape before filling in specifics

## Minimal Constraints Philosophy

By providing:
- A sandboxed environment
- Limited turns per session
- Freedom to explore and organize

The AI can develop a more natural understanding of the project and make meaningful improvements over time without being constrained by overly prescriptive workflows.

I am still searching for the most effective way to frame this approach, but the core principle remains: emergence over prescription.
